the files could be used for Commercial use (free of charge) under one condition - my permission only!
I will provide you additional important production information and guidance.
In order to make it accessible, I am not charging for the files any money. I prefer letting the "market forces" do their magic and make the set affordable for all while they are free.

Please notice:
I highly recommend avoiding anyone who claims to be my "business partner" or asking for free parts on my behalf.
I am a self open source developer that have no other partners and no one represents me other than me. i will never ask for free parts or money.
So, please avoid scammers. Thank you.
